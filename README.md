# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection significantly improves the chances of successful treatment.  
This project uses **machine learning algorithms** to classify breast tumors as **Benign** or **Malignant** based on diagnostic features.
